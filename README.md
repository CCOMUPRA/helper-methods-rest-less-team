This is a simple reusable code for authenticating if a user has a valid session.
The client-side has two JS functions, "isValidSession()" & "checkAndProceed"
The server-side is a Node.js code that uses express and MongoDB
This code is meant to be a starting point and is missing the project specific information. Also areas that need to be replaced are clearly described.
